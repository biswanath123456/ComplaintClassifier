# ComplaintClassifier
Built an intelligent customer complaint classifier that predicts complaint category and priority from raw text. Uses a three-layer priority system combining ML, business rules, and sentiment analysis. Includes a REST API, SQLite persistence, analytics dashboard, and a feedback loop that retrains the model from agent corrections.
