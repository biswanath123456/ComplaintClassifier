"Last july 27, 2010, I called the 1800-Comcast # and of course, the usual introduction been played, like this is recorded for training or whatever purposes. I spoke with customer representative, since my one year subscription for preferred package will expire anytime August. I asked if they have a promotional package wherein I can avail once my old program package expires. This guy named Ira a call center from Mexico. He said he put me in bundle with telephone (unlimited) and cable for $69.99 per month plus tax. I asked about the installation fee and etc. He told me that everything will be waived and assured me that there is no hidden charges when I get my cable bill.Today, August 12, 2010 I receive my bill and Comcast charged me $194.60. I was so shock and *** off and the bottom line is when I called Comcast customer reps, 2 times, they told me such bundle/package is non-existence and they can't pull-out the conversation with the guy, call center in Mexico. They ripped us, mislead us w",Billing,High
"I cancelled Comcast. I returned the boxes and was still receiving bills as if I had service and equipment. After many faxes and attempts, I’m still dealing with it over 2 months later. Then to top it off, Comcast sent a rep to my home, who in turn questioned my 17-year old son about my account, payment and boxes they state I have. No one will acknowledge what happened. No return call or investigation has been done into this. I know it is illegal for this to happen due to my son being under 18 and he even told them this and to wait for me to come home. They told my son to call me and tell me to come home to pay or return the boxes I do not have. To this day, 41 days later, I was told by a rep from Comcast these exact words: “What do you want us to do about it?” I want it fixed. I want an answer for a correct bill to pay and my boxes I returned to show—this is what I want. Nothing done as of yet. No resolution, no call back. Still frustrated with no answers. Can not even give one good st",Billing,High
"Comcast has a feed cable running across the entry of my property. The wire hangs so low, you can touch with your hand. I have been calling them since mid June. I have not been successful in getting a resolution. Currently, I have a motor-home that has been stationary for 2 months, because I cannot drive under the wire. They have promised to repair 8 different times, but never show up. This is a safety risk for my family and friends.",Billing,High
"I called Comcast to make a payment arrangement for my account. I asked the agent to have the funds come out on the Friday. He gave me a confirmation number and assured me that I will not have any interruption with my services. On the Sunday my services (cable, internet and phone) were turned off. I called Comcast and the agent told me that my payment was cancelled and the agent should of called and told me so. The agent said I would have to make a new payment, so I did. On that Tuesday while checking my bank account I saw that two payments were taken out from Comcast. When I called Comcast and told them that they needed to refund one of the payments because I only authorized one they told me no. So I hung up and called back and that agent told me to send in my bank statement that shows Comcast took two payments. So I faxed that over.I called two days later to ask about the status and was once again told that they will not give me back my money. I called three more times and spoke with ",Billing,High
"Buyer beware, I got new services yesterday and today I get a call about a very old bill and was told if that bills not paid in full my services would be cut and immediately they were. Corporate stated they are powerless against the collection team and can do nothing. Unbelievable. They should be put out of business for that kind of customers treatment.",Billing,High
"So these hateful people shipped me products I didn't ask for then sent me a 2nd round of stuff I didn't ask for... When I called I was told just send it back with the prepaid labels. UPS will come to you free of charge. Well... No. No, they will not. It's $15 per package to come to me... Then Comcast has the nerve to charge me $20 a month for the items I didn't request because they are in my possession more than 2 weeks... And I'm told I need to make time to get to UPS or continue with the $20 fee for items I didn't want and couldn't refuse as they were left at my door... What a racket.UPS can get $30 from me for Xfinity/Comcast sending me items I didn't request or Xfinity/Comcast can get $20 a month for me having items I didn't request or want. I called told them I work for a living, can't get to UPS, and explained all the costs and the fact that I didn't agree to have the items or accept the items. You left the items. Should I have left them in the rain to be stolen? The response was",Billing,High
"We had been long time Comcast customers who always paid on time. However, we were traveling overseas and had difficultly getting payments to Comcast. We missed their notices of late payment. When we did pay the amount in full on our return, Comcast had disconnected our services and released our telephone number of 14 years. They could not restore the number for us as it was ""out of the pool."" ",Billing,High
"You can usually get someone on the phone within 5 mins as long as there's not a major issue, in which case they usually have a recording letting you know about it. They tend to want to charge you for everything, but you can talk to a supervisor in many cases and get all or part of the charges removed. We are told we get 50MBPS down speed. That is simply not the case, or I could download a 500MB file in 10 seconds. It normally takes about 1-2 minutes, depending on the time of day. It would make me feel much more warm and fuzzy about Comcast if they actually delivered what they say they deliver download and upload speed-wise, but it's better than C. America!",Billing,Medium
"I move from Florida on end March. By April 15 I was leaving in Sealy, Texas. 3 months later I have a collection company calling me. Comcast is charging for equipment and two months of service June and July. I keep calling to fix the problem, no help. They keep saying that I never call to disconnect the service. The equipment was return to Comcast by UPS. They charging me $537.37 on equipment and service. Also I was talking to the technician and he told me I never pay for cable so ask how is that, he respond was I charge my service for cable to the people with money they never look the bill? To me that was incredible. So we have this people charging others for service.",Billing,High
My service price continues to change. It has run as high as $334 per month and as low as $100 per month. I ordered the triple play with free HBO in August of 2009 and have had to make 4 phone calls to have my bills corrected. Again I am being over charged! Can you please review this account? Today Clarisa at the Union office (she would not give me additional information) was unsure of why this has changed. She also could not make an adjustment to my account. There was no supervisor available and she assured me she would look into this matter. At least 3 hours on the phone.,Billing,High
"Every month in the last year, we have had different payments due. When we call, some offer different rates/promotions so that you will not change your coverage. We were told that our price would be adjusted but were not told that it would only be for 3 months. When we asked why our bill went up $40.00 in one month, Chris said that the special promotion was over... They lie depending who you talk to. Our monthly payments range from $91.87 in Nov. a month to $147.61 February statement. Comcast seems to have the right to change statement rates for any reason based on who answers the phone. Monthly bills should not vary $55.00 for the same coverage.",Billing,High
"I have been overcharged and Comcast could not explain what was going on with my account. They told me 3 different amounts for my bill, 2 different amounts within 20 minutes, I cancelled my service and would never recommend this company to anyone.",Billing,High
"In November of 2012 I stopped my service and moved to my home in Florida, which has Comcast. At that time, I was told my Michigan bill was paid in full. Comcast had been sending a small bill outstanding to an address in Mc Kinney Texas where I have never lived. After several months, they sent it to collections. (They admitted it was their mistake, and would notify the agency). I became aware of it in December of 2013 because it showed up as a collection on my credit report. (My credit score dropped from 830 to 773). Never had a collection in my life. I contacted Comcast and paid the $40 balance owing, and they assured me that they would have that report removed from my credit. As of February 24th, I am now receiving collections statements from Credit Protection Association LP in Dallas Texas sent to my old Michigan address. I spoke to them today and they said Comcast never contacted them to have this removed. Can you believe this, I am a Comcast customer in Florida as well. What the he",Billing,Low
"I am a 67-yr-old man, and have been with Comcast ever since they became a TV cable company!! I recently moved to another state, and had my service transferred!! According to Comcast, every time I change states I must pay for everything all over again. They would not provide any promotions, incentives, or even a prepaid debit card, etc. to stay with them. In effect, I was a new customer that they were going to stack all kinds of charges on my account! I sit here today looking at my first bill in the amount of $237.00, and I live solely on social security!! What am I supposed to do with this!!?? I have tried to talk to a supervisor about helping me with this, but I am always on hold waiting for one of them to get on the line. Nobody ever comes back to the phone... and eventually I am disconnected!! This really blows me away, and I am furious with the company!! I am completely baffled as to what I can do about this!!",Billing,High
"Comcast Cable Service over charging for its HD service. You must pay a $8 fee for each HD cable box, and then pay $6 more for each cable box that has HD service.",Billing,High
"We have been with Comcast over 14 years. We upgraded to a bundle with phone and security. They lied about everything. My bill doubled. What they promised as free, they changed me for and they have been adding charges ever since. For four months, I tried to call them, but they just said they would get back with me and never did. They are a total scam. They are the biggest crooks in the market today. Stay away from all their lies and and overcharges. No one that I know has had a good experience with these cheaters.",Billing,High
"I have been a customer with Comcast for over a year. On June 12, 2009, I found out that there was a notice put on my account by the inner office that will no longer allow me to make payment arrangements. No one could tell me why. All payment arrangements that I have made were honored and paid in full. Therefore, $116.00 was paid on June 13, 2009. To add injury to insult, my service was disconnected on June 26, 2009 without any notice. I was told by a customer service representative that I needed to pay my past due amount by the end of the day on June 26 or a technician would be out the next day to disconnect my service, which in turn could require me to pay a reconnection fee and the entire bill! Of course, I scrambled to make the payment of $129.00 before this predicament occurred knowing that I just made a payment two weeks prior without receiving a bill! The end total that I paid to Comcast for the month of June was $244.00! I would like to inquire why I can no longer make payment a",Billing,High
"I receved my monthly bill from Comcast and I found a onetime charge of $125.00.When I inquired about this charge they said that a check was returned in April 2005. I totally disagree with this as I don't recall any checks being returned, my question to them is why did it take them 3 years to find this out. When I moved my residence I cancelled my services and after moving I got the service back again, at least at that time they should have known that I owe this amount. I refused to pay this amount.Services were disconnected due to past due balance.",Billing,High
"WARNING: COMCAST BUSINESS and COMCAST RESIDENTIAL are similar to discussions with the U.S. and Afghanistan. Different languages, different leaders, different goals and expectations. I live in a high rise building. My office was on the 2nd floor and my residence on the 66th floor. The building recently converted to Comcast and the nightmare began. Currently Comcast -called me- to upgrade my service to X1. I informed them that this is an older building but Comcast just re-wired it.Numerous phone calls, emails, and promises resulted in my phone lines being disconnected and no new service. Business customer service at Comcast stops at 5PM Friday and restarts at 6AM on Monday. My lines went dead at 4:30 PM CST on a Friday. My good fortune was to reach someone, after an 18 minute hold, and request reinstatement of the phone service. It took over 2 hours.I have been in constant contact with the office of Tom Karinshak.

"Very dishonest. Cancelled my service and they kept charging me for 2 subsequent months. Called and they said ""refund check in the mail"". Refund check never arrived. Called again 3 months later (after the 2 subsequent months) and they said I had early termination fees (which is never listed on the bank account summary-only the two monthly charges are listed). And I was not even under a contract. Just keep making up fees to not issue the refund.",Billing,High
"I am so fed up with Comcast. We recently moved to a new house about 2 months ago. Our initial installation was a nightmare. The technincian installed the cable wire through the shower! They had to come back 3 more times to fix the cable, phones and internet. The last 2 bills I have received have been wrong and have taken me over an hour on the phone to straighten out. And they still weren't fixed! Not to mention, our phone didn't work the first 15 days. And when they finally came back to fix it, they unplugged our alarm system that was connected to the phone line. Consequently, our alarm company had to come back, charge us $100 to reconnect and Comcast will not reimburse us. On our last bill, we were charged again for Comcast coming back to fix the internet that never worked in the first place! Is this a joke? Horrible service!",Billing,High
Comcast is the worst cable company. They charge you all these extra fees and on top of that you have to pay an expensive bill. I have one box and my cable with from 50 dollars to 343.60. What kind of ** is that. They should be ashamed of themselves. Besides AT&T doesn't even charge that much.,Billing,High
I started with Comcast 2 years ago and when I started I was paying $89/mo. Before the first year was up I moved and got another good deal to change addresses. After That year my bill jumped to $160. I called to see about changing plans and they gave me BS deals that were a lot less service for only a few bucks cheaper. Turns out once you are a customer then they no longer care about you and will not offer you anything better. Only new customers get better service rates. Only problem is they are the only ones that service internet in my area. Such a scam.,Billing,High
"Brief summary: I live with my brother. Comcast account in his name, I am authorized, I pay the bill. Sometimes he does not give me the bill so have been late here and there. Recently called and paid. They took my money then turned off service the next day. I call, they apologize and turn it back on. I argue there better not be a reconnect fee. They said of course not. Well next few month there was an odd charge of $3 which I asked and they gave me some BS. When I added it up it totaled a reconnect fee... go figure.Fast forward and missed payment. Called, set up arrangement, shut service off. Called, turned it on. Next day, shut service off. Called and told them the arrangement. Had the rudest female ever who said rep should not have done that, turned service on and argued would not be paying 2 reconnect fees. She said, ""Not my problem. Speak to another department"" and ended call. Bogus charges showing on bills. Worst customer service EVER.",Billing,High
"Until VERY recently, technicians would lie to you about what service is available, promise items would be deducted from your bill (only to be re-placed on your bill the next month). Now, however, they are MUCH more pleasant, all the way up to average. Pixelation, almost daily; 5-6 outages a year, down from 10-12. Tallahassee, Florida has the highest Comcast bill in the state, for basic Xfinity service. Xfinity would not work with my new TV (an LG), so I had to use a DTA, instead of a set top box, and I am still using that. That prompted Comcast to bill me for BOTH a set top box and a DTA, and I have tried unsuccessfully for six, yes 6, years to get them to stop doing that, until recently. A technician had to come to my house, and I took the opportunity to walk him around my house so he could see for himself how many cable outlets I have and how many TVs I have. That technician SAYS he fixed my problem, and I will no longer be billed for ""an additional outlet."" We'll see. This is the fi",Billing,Medium
"I called Comcast customer service, and first it took me more than two hours to get a hold of someone. Then they started transferring between different representatives, which all were unprofessional. I understand cost cutting by outsourcing your customer service, but putting unprofessional and skilled people on the other side is a shame. It feels like the company is taking advantage of the fact that they are operating in an oligopoly where they can control the consumer. I think it's time for the government to take action and fine Comcast for their horrible business relationship with the consumers.I had Internet problems for half of the month and couldn't perform my job from the house. I called Comcast customer service, and sent a technician. They also promised me that they will waive this month fee. I decided to ask permission from the representatives and record him promising that he is canceling this particular month bill.

"I am extremely upset with the ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE that I have received from Comcast since we agreed [now, regrettably] to sign up with them back in June 2013. They have billed me incorrectly every month over-charging at least $15/month and then it takes hours of frustration calling them to demand a credit be applied to the account. The Customer Service Agent that I speak to always says that they have the authority to apply the small credits, but they do not appear on my billing statement the following month. Then when I call back, the next agent claims that there is no record that I called in and no record that a credit was to be applied to the account. One time a credit was approved but was later over-turned by someone else who had no contact with me. This is a terrible company to deal with, and I recommend to any potential new cable customers that if you have another alternative then you should go with the other company. However, I have dealt with DirecTV and Dish, and they a",Billing,High
"Kept cutting my service back and raising my rates. Then wanted to force me to rent their converter boxes to accommodate their change in service (which btw was not true for months). And I didn't ask for. Finally I just had snow, even though they told me I would not. So I told them to shut me off. 5 times. Despite this they kept charging me. And each time I called they acted as if I had never called/written to turn off my service. So finally I wrote a letter to the office of the CEO. I had read that Comcast takes customer service seriously. HAH. Some guy from the ""office of the president"" called me. At first he was pleasant. When he realized that I really had no interest in staying with Comcast, he became verbally abusive. Even though I told him I was driving, he asked for specific dates that I had called etc. He threatened to send me to collections, even though I had snow on my screen for 5 months, and they had continued to charge my credit card, until I removed it from the website.

"So originally I had spoke with a Comcast sales representative about lowering my bill. It was part of a special offer for long time customers. She said she would. I find out later, Comcast has been charging me 80 bucks a month for a fairly substandard internet connection (no cable or anything, just internet). This was 35 dollars more than the deal that was promised to me, and worst of all because I'd been auto-paying, I hadn't noticed for several months that this had been going on. So I call them, and let them know. They say there's nothing they can do to lower my bill to the promised rate, but they noticed extra charges that were unnecessary on my account. They assured me over the phone they'd removed some of those charges bringing my monthly bill to about 56-57 dollars including tax. I check my account online. The balance due was indeed lowered to around 57 dollars. However, when I finally do get billed automatically, Comcast again goes back to charging 80 bucks a month! So I call bac",Billing,High
"In November 2013 I purchase a 2012 LG tv. After a few weeks, the tv began to have problems. The signal began making the TV not receive the information quickly. Comcast was called. The tech repaired. However, a few weeks later the problem surfaced again. Comcast was called. We are now in January 2014. Each time Comcast needs to troubleshoot the system even though it was recorded since Nov 2013 the problem existed. Now had one older tv purchased in 2001, no problem with the signal but the newer tv had the problem. Comcast finally repaired it February 2014. There was no conversation when I signed the approval of the repair I would be charged after services were completed. I was not notified prior to completion of services there would be a charge because I didn't have Comcast service plan if something went wrong with their system. When I pay my bill late February there is an extra charge of $55. In billing there was no notification prior to services being rendered there would be a charge. ",Billing,Medium

Instead of fixing the problem, they told me I owed BOTH bills and refused to fix the issue. I ended up canceling their service, and they sent their harassing debt collectors after me for a measly 50 bucks!

"I hate Comcast!  I have had service problems with my cable TV ever since I got a new DTS box.  I have spent weeks on the phone with customer service representatives trying to troubleshoot the problem.  They would send a signal across and the TV would finally work again but go out the very next day.  This happened over six times.  I have had four service calls scheduled and nobody ever showed up.  I took an off at work four times and I have lost vacation time and wages that have cost me over $1,000 so far. Did I say I hate Comcast!  I am sick because of all the stress that they have caused me!  I hate Comcast!  You are full of bunch of lies, cheats, thieves, lies and more lies.  I hate Comcast!  And I really hate lies!

"I have been having trouble with my cable. Mainly, it’s with the TV that has a box where you can not see the TV: it is blank. We go days like this and when you make the appointment, they take at least 4 or 5 days to come. If you call on Monday, they come on Thursday. Call on Saturday and they come on Tuesday. One calls and they treat you as if a child is calling with the following questions after telling them yes: “Do you see anything now? Are you sure you are looking at the screen? Is the problem happening to all the TVs?” One asks for a supervisor and they say no one is around or on duty no matter what time or day one calls. They proceed to give you another rep who knows less and starts to ask the same questions and treat you as a child. Please, if we pay late, they cut you for one month of service. They claim to give you a credit, but the bill is always higher and you still have to wait the days. I have 6 kids here and run a daycare and they only know they cannot see TV.",Billing,High
Honestly worst company I have ever used. After months of terrible service and lies I decided to switch to Fios. I canceled my Comcast service so it would stop when my Fios was installed. Comcast turned my service off 2 days early. So I called and spent hours on phone to have it turned back on. Then the next day they turned it off again (a day early still). I called back and they said it was an issue with modem but they can send out a tech (the appt they offered was on same day Fios was coming out and when my service was set to be turned off). I asked them if they understood how stupid this was. They would not answer the question. I know they are just messing with me because I am switching to Fios. Please avoid this company at all costs.,Billing,High
"As usual the Comcast representatives are very ignorant by definition and implication. I discontinued all services in January 2010, dropped off all equipment in person to the Greensburg office and asked the rep. how much my final bill would be. She said my service was stopped and that they would be out to shut the line off in February, but I did not need to be there. She continued to explain that I would not owe anything, that actually I would have a credit. Unfortunately, I thought this would be the end of the matter, but for Comcast, bills always continue to come. Shortly after, I received a bill due Feb. 14 for $106.84, $5 of which was for a modem I had returned in December. Keeping in mind, I discontinued billing in mid Jan., I then received a second bill for $203.26 due now. I no longer live at the Fern Drive address. I was shot in Aug. 2009 and I am disabled. This is why I changed residence and firmly informed Comcast by phone and in person that I would no longer need service. Yet",Billing,High

When I spoke to Jessica, she offered me a plan that would include a lot more stations plus Cinemax and HBO plus a faster internet speed. The cost would be only a dollar or so more. Fine, I want it. It will not cost me $99.99 a month. She would be giving me a credit of $20.00 a month for six months which would bring the total amount to $79.99 but I would be getting more TV and faster internet at 12 MB. I am disabled and have been out of work for a very long time. This sounds wonderful, I was so happy. After six months, it would go back to the $99.99 a month.

The first three phone calls I made they said they had made a mistake and that my money would be credited back. Now they are saying, (after 6 calls) that the contract was never verified. But it was.

"On September 30th Comcast revised their terms of service to denote that a monthly bandwith cap of 250GB has been determined.  If a customer goes over 250GB two months out of the year, their service will be shut off.  On October 25th, Comcast announced they will no longer provide newsgroup service to its customers. Between those two periods, Comcast also sent letters to their customers informing them of rate increases. I called to inquire how my prices could possibly increase, and the service that Comcast provide decrease.  I spoke with several supervisors, yet no one could adjust my monthly rate, or explain why I am getting less for more.

She said, we can give you a discount but with the package you have, it would be cheaper. So I decided to stay with the package. Then she told me, what I can do for you to substitute the discount is not to charge you for the installation and box fee. I told her, are you sure?

After filing police reports, faxing information, mailing duplicate sets of information, and making another round of phone calls in an attempt to reach someone in Atlanta, Georgia, I was told by an individual in Georgia that they agreed it had been theft and I was not responsible for this debt.

After a month when the renters left, I called Comcast to put the service for minimum charges at $39.99 per month.

I then asked them to put the property on seasonal hold and they agreed to do so. It has been over a month and I still continue to receive the same charges.

"Ordered the TV & Internet double package that I received from Xfinity mailer promotion. When installer arrived, he had been given a different order to install incorrect boxes and service. Some of this problem was corrected while he was doing the install, however after installation, I found I was billed way above the quoted costs. After 3 1/2 hours on the phone with 8 different representatives, I was still not given the package that was advertised and now 2 of the receiver boxes continue to drop signal. I am averaging 11/2 hour per day trying to get this corrected. My internet speed is not the speed I was told I would receive. I tried to replace one of the receivers that is dropping and was sent a box that was not what I ordered. Customer service reps seem to be of no help and only answer any question by reading their prepared texts. Now I find that pending charges exceed quoted prices again. I can guarantee that when my contract expires. Xfinity will never have me as a customer again.",Billing,High
"Comcast charged me for the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight that did not play. They claimed that shows up in their system as the event did play for 54 minutes, when in fact it did not. I have an SD box so I ordered it on the phone in Standard Definition and they charged me for HD. They said that in their system shows up as if I ordered from the box in HD. The fact is that I could not play the fight. When I try to call, the lines were super busy because apparently million of people were having the same issue. I've waited on the lines for approximately hour and a half and finally gave up and hang up. The charge did not show up in my account online, so I assumed I was not going to be charged with all that fuzz going on. And of course I forgot about it because believe it or not some people do have to work for a living and can not be on the phone all day and make our lives about Comcast.Of course a month later the $99 dollars show up on my account and when I called they said it was too late, that ",Billing,High

First in March 2007 I added phone service and was told w/the internet & television it would cost me $129.99. After installation the next day I had no service for all 3 of the above.

I have contacted them for the problem with the phone service with no resolution. They have been charging me $129.99+ on my bill (even though the service was not correct) On my 9/15/2007 bill they increased my bill by $22.11 & 17.80.

"I have had Comcast Cable service starting April 2012. From May 2012, I started having issues - tiling, freezing up, distorted sound which froze up the computer. I complained every month for 10 months; techs were with supervisors trying to repair the issue. They did not. On Feb. 08, 2013, techs replaced the cable from outside box to my apartment. I still had the same issue. A week later, Comcast turned off my service, stating I owed $242.36, which I was to have credits, but they did not see it that way. I paid that amount - service was restored. Then approx. a week after that, they, after getting the $242.36 payment, turned my service off permanently as of Feb. 22, 2013. I am on disability. TV is my entertainment. They are a monopoly. They only care about the money - not the customer or service. So what if you have issues? Comcast doesn't care - they only want new customer's money.

The customer service agent submitted a ticket for that amount to be credited back to me. I was happy.

Since the check was never submitted for payment it stands to reason the check could not possibly bounce as they claimed. The only way I was able to have my services restored, and avoid being turned over to a collection agency, was to agree to pay Comcast a $30 fee for the ""mysterious"" bounced check.

They had to replace my 2 DVR boxes at least 5 times each because they kept replacing them with used units that still had the previous customers recording settings and recorded shows. The hard drives kept freezing up and suddenly failed. I ended up having to contact the Comcast executive customer care department, who finally had a senior level tech from a different region come out to resolve the issues. I am now without issues for about 3 weeks.My suggestion is, if you continue to have issues with Comcast, contact your customer service department and have them forward you to the executive customer care department for your area.  This group generally will take care of you.",Technical,Medium

Now this time, the internet has been mostly down for a week and I can only use the internet for about 20 minutes a day if I am lucky. All my equipment is new and up to date just like Comcast ask me to do but I am still having problems. This has been and is a common routine and Comcast does not give a damn. I am sick of paying for services that I cannot use and I cannot afford the installation fees for another company.

It's a little insulting to have my bill increase every 3-6 months and get less service as a result.Don't even ask me or any other Comcast/Xfinity customer about calling in about service outages or pointless increasing price issues.

"I have recently ordered two movies (and several more in the past) from On-Demand that were shown to be close captioned but were not. I am deaf and could not enjoy the movie without the close captioning. It is not right that I should pay for movies that I cannot enjoy. Also, it is very frustrating to select a movie that states it is close captioned and then find out I cannot watch it. The two movies were ""Real Steel"" and ""The Thing 2011."" I have complained about this before. You need to ensure that if a movie listing indicates that is close captioned with the CC symbol that it actually is.",Other,Medium

I am fairly certain that Comcast (Xfinity) went to the new format to make it harder for you to go anywhere other than within the Xfinity System. Not sure why but their TV Listings and ability to program from there were very workable. They did away with all of the TV schedule filters and various time elements. IT SUCKS BIG TIME! I have been a customer for about 30 years. I think everyone who has been with them for any period of time knows that new subscribers will always get a better deal. Customer loyalty is worth zero to them! I am anxiously awaiting full service Google cable!!!,Other,Medium
"When watching Comcast television shows I sometimes need to use the on-demand feature to catch up on the show I missed. When doing this I take note of the length of the show and whether the show can be fast forwarded through commercials. I try to not watch shows that can't be fast forwarded but occasionally it's necessary. If I wait more than a week, some shows have less commercials and show up as a shorter time than they had when originally aired. Lately I've noticed that Comcast lies about the length of the shows it shows on on-demand. One hour shows are presented as 45 minutes, but when viewed, the on-demand show continues to stretch out in time to 55 to 56 minutes in length. They pretend to cut commercials but really do not. I suppose this stops a lot of people from buying DVR's.",Other,Medium
"I just switched to Xfinity from U-verse. The DVR from Xfinity is in one word ""terrible"" as compared to the DVR from U-verse. The issues that I have discovered about the DVR is: when you record a 30-minute program, it only records 29 minutes. If you record a program that is 60 minutes long it only records 59 minutes. You must go and add in 1 or 5 minutes to record the tail end of a program. U-verse automatically adds on 2 minutes. There is no ""STOP"" button on the remote just a pause/play button. If you are watching a recorded program and you decide to stop and delete it you have to pause it, go back to the Xfinity button, go to saved programs, select the program highlight, and delete it. Then you have to permanently delete it. Too many steps. U-verse has a stop button and you can delete it immediately. Another issue I have is that there is no list of programs (series) that you can review from time to time to see if you don't want to record anymore. U-verse has that feature.

Calls from their tech support 32 times, using 334 minutes of my phone time (at $0.29/min that comes to $96.28 in call time).

When I scheduled installation for the earliest date (five days later on the Friday), I explained that my contractor would meet the Comcast technician.

Not only have I still NOT received my cable installment that was scheduled 2 weeks in advance and planned to be installed on Friday, Nov. 6, 2015, but your customer service reps just continued to lie and waste my time. Needless to say no one ever showed up Friday night after me waiting over 4 hours! (And it was my daughter's birthday.) No call to apologize for not showing up. No prompt service to show up the next day in an effort to accommodate my time wasted and lost. No one has made a peep! And when I've gone the route of calling customer service, they let me know they can never reach your dispatchers, put me on hold over and over, only to tell me they will call back which they never do. You can imagine my frustration at this point. The quality of your service is below poor. You clearly do not care about your customers or potential customers for that matter.

"I tried to get hold of Comcast installation department and went through CSR and supervisor but to no avail. They do not have any info in regards the installation crew nor do they have a telephone number and/or an email. I had a Comcast technician climb my 6-1/2 ft. fence (because the gate was locked and I was home at the time and no one tried to let me know that they needed to get into the back yard). Also, the access to the poles that were needed was on another property and not mine. I do not have Comcast so I was pretty upset as there is a reason for the locked gate; we have a pool and also two dogs (good thing they were not out at the time). He was there with another technician who eventually knocked on the door (I think) as I didn't hear him.The dogs let me know and when I confronted him about his partner already being in the yard and how he got into the yard, he said he didn't know.

Have had Comcast and moved to a new home 1/2/16. Talked with numerous people at Comcast... My service was not stopped at the old address. Did not get a technician to the new address until 1/19... They did not finish and another technician came 1/21 and installed old cable boxes (3). I called several times and new boxes were mailed. As of 2/18 only one of the 3 tvs in my home works sometimes. Billing is still not resolved for the old address. Getting new bills for the new address when I had NO SERVICE and now another technician is coming 1/20 to resolve the problems and am being charged AGAIN for installation??? I cannot believe the customer service had been so poor. Your tagline... the future of awesome... It's definitely in the future because the last 7 weeks have been a nightmare.

I was told there was no installation fee because I was a new customer. I called and, of course, they dance around what I was told and tell me I have to pay the installation fee. This is so unfair and sad that a company as large as Comcast would play these games to get a customer to sign up and then they screw you over with added fees. What happened to honesty and giving a customer what you promised? The guy that came to install the internet couldn't even help me setup my computer because he does not know the Apple computer. I had to pay someone else to come setup my computer. The installer didn't give me a so called welcome package and didn't do anything but connect from the outside. Now, let’s be fair.

We also received a call the day before confirming the install. No one showed up, so we called Comcast and were told we were mistaken, that our installation was scheduled for 9/1/2015 between 3 pm - 5 pm. We asked how come no one called to let us know since the video they sent us as preparation for the install instructed us to have our telephone installed to hook up the new service to our phone system.

Imagine being hold for over an hour to pay them and they couldn't service me. Completely unacceptable! Comcast knows it has a monopoly on the cable market.

The following 2 days, I had to call again, still no result. Some people are getting to the point they don't want to call me. Where do I turn to get this mess fixed? Comcast had gotten too big.

No one showed so I called Comcast, they said that the wrong type of tech. was dispatched and that they would definitly have the right kind there before 7p. No one showed so I called again.  They said that the tech was running late and would be there by 7:30p.  No one showed up so I called again.  They said that there was no record of a tech being dispatched to my address.  I told them that wasn't acceptable since i'd been waiting since before 3p.  They offered to re-schedule the appt.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  After 10 more minutes on hold, I got a supervisor.  He told me that no one shown up because it was so late.  I told him that that was a different story than the previous person",Delivery,High
"We set up an appointment to have an HD/DVR box on Thursday, March 1st between 5PM-7PM. A technician came out who could barely speak English. After an hour of being on hold with dispatch, he attempted to install a box that did not work. He then attempted to install two other boxes that he had in his truck, but neither of them worked or could not be installed to my TV apparently because it was not HDMI-ready. I put the order in a week ago and informed Comcast of what cable box was needed and necessary for installation. After another hour of trying to communicate with dispatch, the technician informed me that he would be out the next evening to install a temporary box until the correct HD/DVR box became available. I also spoke to a supervisor on the phone who assured me that I would have a cable box the following night regardless.The following evening, we waited three hours for a technician to arrive, never received a call until the last hour from someone stating that there was no cable b",Delivery,High
"There was a Comcast technician in my apartment complex on Sunday 7/31/11, performing a new install for another customer who lives in the same section. During this time, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, my cable service was disconnected and I waited to see if my service would return, but it did not.I immediately called Comcast to report what happened and to get a Comcast technician back to fix their problem. After two attempts with a representative, I asked for an on-duty supervisor and those attempts never happened after waiting on the phone for one hour each time I called. I finally used their live chat on the website and was given the run-around again. They stated that they cannot send out a technician until the following day or next.Comcast should have handled my issue with priority and at all costs send someone out immediately because this was one of their employees who caused this outage.

"I had to spend about seven hours either on the phone or on hold with a representative. I had called because I needed to have my equipment installed, I already had the equipment that I picked up from Comcast. To make an appointment I had to get a manager on the phone to speak with me. He told me I wouldnt be charged for the installation. I waited around the whole day of the scheduled appointment. No one showed up. They canceled and didnt call my phone. I had to call back to customer service so I could reschedule the appointment and they told me there was no previous appointment. I was a bit frustrated by then. Only because they told me they couldnt get me anyone until Sept 12 and I was calling on Sept 3. I waited patiently until Sept 12 for the service.

The customer service rep apologized for the tech not showing up and stated I would get a $20 credit and rescheduled my appointment to Feb. 6 from 8:00-10:00. The technician did not show up again, I never received a phone call or anything to cancel the appointment and after calling, the agent told me that it was cancelled due to lack of the pre-payment.

"I went to have internet service installed. I am deaf (Military incident) and cannot converse over the phone. I paid Comcast slightly over $100.00 and received a do-it yourself package in shrink wrap. At the designated time I was at my address waiting for installation. Two Comcast trucks showed up. I had the red Comcast bag with the equipment sitting on the hood. They passed within 10 feet. Five hours later they were still doing??? I walked up to one of them and pointed to my truck with the Comcast bag and asked what I could do to help. I got blank looks and later they just drove off. I took my receipt to the Comcast store and asked why I did not get installation. I was told ""They (meaning someone in that same store in customer service) ""should never have sold you that package.""We will need to charge you an extra $70.00 for the installation. I replied  ""all I need is the cable feed."" FCC regulations will not allow us to do that. I knew that to be untrue. I went home, gathered up the bag",Delivery,High
"I have had so much trouble with this company! Some must be due to incompetence and some must be treachery. It took at least 5 techs to install. They keep quoting me one price on the phone, then billing me for another. They gave my unlisted phone number to some other company to make threatening calls to my mother and me about turning in equipment or paying $500 fines; the representative never told me I had to return any equipment after I had services downgraded. I spend at least an hour a week with these incompetents and/or liars. Tomorrow, I must take another day off work to go there in person and see what is going on. I cannot budget on my limited income if they keep jacking around the prices. They had no right to give my unlisted number to another entity. I just found out the installation technician took my mother's remote controls when he installed the cable. I have complained to the City of Mountain View as they hold the franchise.

I called twice this morning to give them and confirm my cell # as I was at work.. Comcast promised on both occasions when I called this morning that the tech would call me on my cell to let me know he was on the way so I could meet him there.... I waited the entire two hour window for the tech to call me. When I decided to call to see where the text was, I was told by Comcast they text called my home # knocked on the door and then left....

"My mother's phone was out and I called for service, saying she is 97 years old and needs a phone at all times. The service people checked the connection and said that indeed, she DID need a technician and that on an emergency basis, they would get one out the next day. I went to her home which is in a retirement community to wait. After a couple of hours, I decided to call them to make sure they knew where it was, and get an update from them.I got on the automated service, gave my phone number, and they told me they would be there within the next half hour. ""Great,"" I thought. Then the automated service said, ""Do you want to cancel this appointment?"" I said, ""NO!"" The automated voice came back and said, ""Your appointment is canceled."" Needless to say, I was very upset. It took me eight minutes to get to a real person after that, and they said that there was NOTHING they could do about this.

At 0955, the supervisor of the service technician called and said they'll be running late sometime after 1030 hrs.

The tech shows up after getting lost only tell us that he had no DVR box on his truck and in fact had no idea that that was the reason for the visit. My wife told him to go get out and go home.

The phone message indicated that they needed to cut up my driveway in order to install underground cable for a neighbor two doors down. He asked me to please call. The call came at 2:21 p.m. They had made a similar request about a year prior and requested to string cable through my property. I denied access for this application because I was out of state and did not understand their intention clearly and it just plain seemed like a bad idea.

The saga continues. First about 2 years ago when my area changed to digital Comcast refused to send anyone to install the converter boxes on my add sets. Thane insisted that I come to their office to pick them up. They finally mailed them and on my next bill they added shipping charges after telling me that I would have 2 free of charge since I needed 3. They billed me for the shipping on all of them. After going to DISH Network over this I returned to Comcast a little over a year ago. Starting 2 days after the install I began losing sound and had to change channels to get the sound back. After 8 service calls I gave up and lived with it. Now the service shuts down. Locks on one channel and if you try and change channels it tells you to unplug and reboot the converter.

As he fumbled around my home, he kept telling me things he could not do, like fix a line in my office that would allow the modem to be placed where I needed it, place a DVR in my bedroom as I'd requested, and provide a cord to go from the wall port to the DVR unit in my family room. I thought these were the basic functions of a technician, but I was told otherwise.All of this would have just been a minor annoyance if the next issues would not have occurred.

They said they will check it out.On Sunday, I called and again after 10 minutes was told that an appointment had been made and was for the following Tuesday as the first appointment.

We was patient as long as we could be but after attempts to come to some compromise on the phone, now have to pay an additional 90 dollars to get out of the contract.

After calling them up, I was told that, since they don't have any record for giving me assurance of not charging for visit, they cannot do anything on this. On top of this, the support person was laughing over the phone. Ridiculous! Please don't ever think of good support service from Comcast. Service wise they are OK, but not good.

On the 17th at 6 pm, I had two boxed installed. On the 17th at 9pm, the second box stops working. So I called tech support who could not understand what the issue was. Of course, they gave me another appointment for a time that I would not be able to be home (12 pm to 2 pm). I waited all day on the 18th for someone to come; no one showed. No call either. Today the 19th, I called to schedule someone to come out to the house. They stated that someone showed up on the 18th and there was no answer. That’s not true. We were waiting.

It was rescheduled for Wednesday, March 5 between 1-3pm. I decided to drive to the Lake Worth location and replace the box myself. They were very nice at that location. I replaced the box myself, called the number provided, 1-855-OK-BEGIN. Went through an automated sequence, but the cable box didn't respond. But, at least the BYPASS light was illuminated (the box I returned was totally dead). I was told it would take 45 minutes (by the automation) for the system to load the information.

A few days later Comcast showed up, to fix the line on the property close to the house. The technician stated that he was not equipped to fix the line on the street, and that we needed a bucket truck with a street crew.  He noted on his form which I signed noting that there was an additional problem needing to be  fixed on the street. A call was made to Comcast to follow up, we were told that ""yes, there are two separate orders"", one for the house, and one for the street.

She walks me through how to reset the phone line (but that did not work) then she tries to send a signal to the box (and that does not work).

A few weeks ago I attempted to record a program with my HD DVR from Comcast. It appeared like it was setup, but when I went to watch the program, I got a message that said this service was disabled.  I called Comcast, spent about an hour and a half on the phone with a very nice customer service rep, who said I basically did not have the DVR service.  I am a NEW customer as of this January 08 and I HAVE USED the DVR service several times to record programming that I would watch at a later date..so I DID HAVE the service.

We had to have a filter removed that Comcast had evidently placed on an outside line years ago. We made eight calls to Comcast on the telephone tree waiting endlessly and being transferred. One call was 86 minutes and 57 seconds on hold! We still do not have cable service.We were promised an 'emergency visit' yesterday and no one called or came to the house.

I went in person to their location at 1139 N Federal Hwy, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304 and David at the counter told me that they ‘can’t handle business accounts’ and referred me back to calling them on the phone.I disconnected the modem, I am not using the service and I do not want to pay for it anymore.

He then put me on a ""short hold"" for 12 minutes then I got put through to the Spanish speaking department! I am quite sure he did that deliberately. What a totally useless company Comcast is.

We went to the office in Wheat Ridge, CO and were promised a supervisor would call. She never did. We went to Comcast Chat services twice and were sent back to New Customer Service.

The operator I spoke with stated that there were no outages in my area and they had to send out a tech. So I stay home all day Saturday (cancelling plans) to wait. No one shows and when I called, they told me that there was an outage in the area and as such, they cancel their appointments when they fix an outage.

"I am a Comcast business class subscriber. I used the business line for a home office in Chicago. Comcast constantly goes down. I would say that at least twice a month for the past 10 months, there is always a problem affecting the area. Since the line is leased, cancellation comes with a hearty price. When contacting Comcast it is the same story. The best one was that their DNS was down. I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS. I suppose, point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does?",Account,Medium
"No written contract. When I call I am shuffled around. When my alarm needed servicing, I was charged $50 without warning. Always seem to have TV and internet - except for a few times when the router went out or some such thing. When I signed up for a 3 year contract I got no written contract, nothing in writing and in my 3rd year my price skyrocketed (supposed to be a $10 increase per year). I think Comcast's motto is to get the most money you can out of the most customers. Highly unethical - and don't bother calling the AG's office or complaining to the FTC. They don't care and only send you back to Comcast to re-hash your problem. We pay waaay toooo much for these services. And I am a nex cable subscriber - having just got it Nov. 2013. My internet has gone out a few times and I need to call in - or go online to reboot it. Pain. TC/Cable and telephone seem most reliable. Again they gave me no manuals or paperwork/contract.

"Customer service reps are generally polite and helpful, as long as the concern is one they know how to address. If they aren't able to address the issue quickly, I have been disconnected. Initially pretty good. Recent ""upgraded"" remote does not accommodate a surround sound system. I'm back to using 2 remotes. Three days a month of lost service. Hours on the phone trying to get service back. They decided I lived in a different town than the one I live in, which has caused issues since initiating service a number of years ago. If I had another choice, I would drop Comcast. The new ""upgraded"" system was a pain to install, required hours on the phone and in their chat room to get it going. Some features are good on the new remote, lack of ability to sync with surround sound system is not good. Once problems start they can continue repeatedly for 24-48 hours. Generally service reliable, except when it is not! Chat room assistance is a joke. Wish I had another choice.",Account,Medium
"Awful, 3 days to come out when an outside cable was cut somewhere. Service people, both at the call centers and technicians that come to your house, are untrained and don't understand how their equipment works. Recently Comcast forced me to upgrade to Xfinity by popping up a message on our TVs every 1/2 hour or so saying that if we didn't upgrade we would lose access to some of our stations. We always paid a little extra to have 2 separate Comcast DVD recorders so my wife and could record and delete our own programs on our separate TVs. When I was forced to upgrade I contacted Comcast Xfinity department on 3 separate occasions to confirm that if we installed 2 Xfinity DVDs we could still record and delete programs independently on our respective TVs and there would be no increase in cost.When I installed the Xfinity DVRs there was no way to keep them separate as they both kept programs on the same web based cloud server. Delete a program from one and it is deleted from both DVRs. Calle",Account,Medium

"So we're moving to a home we just built, from a rental property (less than 2 miles away) and called Comcast because moving your service is so easy with them right. The initial call was on Oct. 6th, after several more calls an appointment was finally scheduled (without our knowledge) for Friday, Oct. 23rd. After a few more calls and telling them that we're cancelling their service, they had a rep available immediately. We still ended our relationship with Comcast. We were fortunate in that we did not have a one or two year contract, otherwise we would have been stuck.

Three years ago, I was divorced from my husband of 23 years. He left the area (in haste) moving to Arkansas. Unbeknownst to me the cable services were in his name. The reason I was not aware of this was because I went to the cable company and they changed the bill to my name and never informed me that the account was in his name. The problem came this January when I went to reduce my services to just internet. I was informed that I could not reduce services because he had moved back to the area and had services at his new home as well as my residence in his name.

"After cancelling Comcast services, Comcast still billed me US$70.82 for internet services which were not provided by them. Comcast is using probably inappropriate business practices to bill the customers for services not provided by them. When the services were switched from Comcast to AT&T, Comcast knows that all the services are cancelled. There is no need for consumer to inform Comcast that each and every separate service has been cancelled and needs to be terminated. Then what is the meaning of bundling services like XFINITY? Comcast, when marketing their product and selling the products, loves to bundle. But when disconnecting, Comcast forgets that it is bundled service. Comcast must stop billing customers for all services under their bundle once the Comcast account is transferred to another carrier. Comcast must confirm which services are active and which are cancelled and bill the consumers for only those services that are still active with Comcast. Be fair with consumers.",Account,Medium

I called to have an extension on my payment until Friday and they advise me they can’t because the account is past due, and that the reconnection fee is only $5.00 if my Internet is turned off. It is ok to increase the monthly charges on a past due account but not schedule extensions to prevent additional charges from being added.
